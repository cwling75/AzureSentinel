This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/)._\n\n**Note:** _There may be [known issues](https://aka.ms/sentinelsolutionsknownissues) pertaining to this Solution, please refer to them before installing._\n\nSemperis Directory Services Protector (DSP) provides valuable insight into your Active Directory security posture. It queries your Active Directory environment and performs a set of tests against many aspects of Active Directory's security posture, including AD Delegation, Account security, AD Infrastructure security, Group Policy security, and Kerberos security. Each security indicator is mapped to MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework categories, explains what was evaluated, and indicates how likely an exposure will compromise Active Directory. Each IoE found highlights weak Active Directory configurations and provides actionable guidance on how to close gaps before they are exploited by attackers. Using this workbook, you can determine how you are doing from a security perspective, compared to best practice environments. In case of security regressions, Semperis Directory Services Protector will trigger alerts through Azure Sentinel.\n\nAzure Sentinel Solutions provide a consolidated way to acquire Azure Sentinel content like data connectors, workbooks, analytics, and automations in your workspace with a single deployment step.\n\n**Data Connectors:** 1, **Parsers:** 1, **Workbooks:** 1, **Analytic Rules:** 5\n\n[Learn more about Azure Sentinel](https://aka.ms/azuresentinel) | [Learn more about Solutions](https://aka.ms/azuresentinelsolutionsdoc)",
