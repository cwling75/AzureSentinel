## Summary
 When a new Azure Sentinel incident is created, this playbook gets triggered and performs the below actions:
 1. Fetches a list of potentially malicious URLs.
 2. For each URL in the list, checks if the URL is blocked by the network of the organization.
  - If URL is allowed by the network, then incident comment is created saying URL is allowed.
  - If URL is blocked by the network, then incident comment is created saying URL is blocked.
  - If URL is not blocked by the network and not part of the network, that URL is blocked by playbook.
3. Update the incident with status 'Closed' and reason as
  - For allowed URL - 'BenignPositive - SuspiciousButExpected'
  - For blocked URL - 'TruePositive - SuspiciousActivity'

  Captures potentially malicious or malware URL incident information.

## Entities - Get URLs
  Get the list of URLs as entities from the Incident.

 *  If organization name does not exist, then terminate with the error that organization not found.

 ## Check if network exists
  *  If network name exists in list of networks associated with the organization, then return network associated with the organization. 
 *  If network name does not exist, then terminate with the error that network not found.

## For each malicious URL received from the incident
 - Checks if the URL is blocked or allowed by the network of the organization.
   - If URL is allowed by the network then incident comment is created saying URL is allowed using content filtering.
   - If URL is blocked by network then incident comment is created saying URL is blocked using content filtering.
   - If URL is not part of the network, then such URL is blocked by playbook using content filtering. Incident Comment is created saying URL blocked by playbook.
