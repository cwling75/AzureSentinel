Once added to your SIGNL4 team, the connector will read security alerts from Azure Graph Security API and fully automatically and trigger alert notifications to your team members on duty. It will also synchronize the alert status from SIGNL4 to Graph Security API, so that if alerts are acknowledged or closed, this status is also updated on the according Azure Graph Security API alert or the corresponding security provider. As mentioned, the connector mainly uses Azure Graph Security API, but for some security providers, such as Azure Sentinel, it also uses dedicated REST APIs from according Azure solutions.",

            "description": "Azure Sentinel is a cloud native SIEM solution from Microsoft and a security alert provider in Azure Graph Security API. However, the level of alert details available with the Graph Security API is limited for Azure Sentinel. The connector can therefore augment alerts with further details (insights rule search results), from the underlying Azure Sentinel Log Analytics workspace. To be able to do that, the connector communicates with Azure Log Analytics REST API and needs according permissions (see below). Furthermore, the app can also update the status of Azure Sentinel incidents, when all related security alerts are e.g. in progress or resolved. In order to be able to do that, the connector needs to be a member of the 'Azure Sentinel Contributors' group in your Azure Subscription.\n **Automated deployment in Azure**\n The credentials required to access the beforementioned APIs, are generated by a small PowerShell script that you can download below. The script performs the following tasks for you:\n - Logs you on to your Azure Subscription (please login with an administrator account)\n - Creates a new enterprise application for this connector in your Azure AD, also referred to as service principal\n - Creates a new role in your Azure IAM that grants read/query permission to only Azure Log Analytics workspaces.\n - Joins the enterprise application to that user role\n - Joins the enterprise application to the 'Azure Sentinel Contributors' role\n - Outputs some data that you need to configure app (see below)",

If you don't want to use the connector with Azure Sentinel, you could remove all role creation and role assignment code and only use it to create the app registration (SPN) in your Azure Active Directory.\n3. Run the script. At the end it outputs information that you need to enter in the connector app configuration.\n4. In Azure AD, click on 'App Registrations'. Find the app with the name 'SIGNL4AzureSecurity' and open its details\n5. On the left menu blade click 'API Permissions'. Then click 'Add a permission'.\n6. On the blade that loads, under 'Microsoft APIs' click on the 'Microsoft Graph' tile, then click 'App permission'.\n7.
