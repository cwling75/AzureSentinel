  "Description": "The [Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/identity-services-engine/data_sheet_c78-656174.html) is your one-stop solution to streamline security policy management and reduce operating costs. With ISE, you can see users and devices controlling access across wired, wireless, and VPN connections to the corporate network.",
  "WorkbookDescription": "Cisco ISE allows you to provide highly secure network access to users and devices. It helps you gain visibility into what is happening in your network, such as who is connected, which applications are installed and running, and much more. It also shares vital contextual data, such as user and device identities, threats, and vulnerabilities with integrated solutions from Cisco technology partners, so you can identify, contain, and remediate threats faster.",
