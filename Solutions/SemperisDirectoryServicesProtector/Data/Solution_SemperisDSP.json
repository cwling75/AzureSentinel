  "Description": "Semperis Directory Services Protector (DSP) provides valuable insight into your Active Directory security posture. It queries your Active Directory environment and performs a set of tests against many aspects of Active Directory's security posture, including AD Delegation, Account security, AD Infrastructure security, Group Policy security, and Kerberos security. Each security indicator is mapped to MITRE ATT&CKÂ® framework categories, explains what was evaluated, and indicates how likely an exposure will compromise Active Directory. Each IoE found highlights weak Active Directory configurations and provides actionable guidance on how to close gaps before they are exploited by attackers. Using this workbook, you can determine how you are doing from a security perspective, compared to best practice environments. In case of security regressions, Semperis Directory Services Protector will trigger alerts through Azure Sentinel.",
