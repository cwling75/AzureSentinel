# Overview
---
This solution enables SecOps Analysts, Threat Intelligence Professional, and Threat Hunters to gain situational awareness for threats in cloud environment. The Solution includes (2) Workbooks and (1) Notebook for comprehensive threat hunting. Threat modeling is an advanced discipline requiring a detailed understanding of adversary actions. Threat analysis provides an understanding of where the attacker is in the cycle which often drives both a historic lens of where the threat may have progressed, but also predictive analytics on the threat‚Äôs objectives. This approach is adversarial as understanding of the threat‚Äôs attack cycle drives defense actions in a red versus blue model. The Threat Analysis & Response Solution augments the customer burden of building threat hunting programs. Microsoft Sentinel Hunting maps MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ Tactics/Techniques to Hunting Queries. This Sentinel Solution includes (2) Workbooks and a Notebook which provides the foundation to build a threat hunting program across cloud and hybrid computing environments. <br>

# Workbooks
## 1) Threat Analysis & Response Workbook
This workbook provides the foundation for building a threat hunting program including references for analytics and hunting query repositories. There are data source statistics to baseline available data sets which is helpful in planning selection of analytics rules. There is a breakdown of ATT&CK tactics to understand focus areas for greater analysis. There is an assessment of detection platform services to understand which capabilities and workloads are being employed. <br>
## 2) Threat Analysis & Response for Cloud Workbook
This workbook is designed for response to threat tactics. It enables SecOps Analysts, Threat Intelligence Professionals, and Threat Hunters to gain situational awareness for threats in cloud environment. This workbook is designed to augment staffing through automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, query+alerting generation and visualizations. Threat modeling is an advanced cybersecurity discipline requiring detailed knowledge of identifying and acting on the attacker based on observation of indicators in various stages of the attack cycle. This offering provides granular situational awareness across the ATT&CK for Cloud Matrix including 75+ Tactic/Technique cards demonstrating a red versus blue approach to threat modeling. This offering augments the advanced cybersecurity skillsets required for threat modeling and provides actionable insights across 25+ Microsoft products.<br>

# Notebook
The Threat Analysis & Response Notebook This notebook builds upon the ATT&CK workbooks to analyze and model threat behavior across the ATT&CK enterprise matrix. This includes custom heat mapping for exportable reports. It also provides a posture assessment to determine areas of coverage and highlights areas for further analysis/remediations.
