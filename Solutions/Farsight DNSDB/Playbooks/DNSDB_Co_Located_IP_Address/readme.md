# DNSDB_Co_Located_IP_Address
author: Henry Stern, Farsight Security, Inc.

This playbook uses the Farsight DNSDB connector to automatically enrich IP Addresses found in the Sentinel incidents. This lookup will identify all the IPs that are co-located (based on Domain) based on the on the input of a IP Address. This would be set of IPs that also shared the same Domain as the originating IP address. 
Learn more about the integration via the https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/farsightdnsdb/ or visit https://www.farsightsecurity.com/about-farsight-security/contacts/ to request a trial key.
