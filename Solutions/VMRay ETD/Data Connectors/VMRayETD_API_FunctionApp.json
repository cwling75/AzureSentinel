If you are using ETD On Premises, see the *Setting up Users and Assigning Roles* section of the *On Premises Installation Guide* for more information.\n\nNext, create an API key for that user, which will be used by the Azure Sentinel connector. For detailed instructions, refer to the *API Programmer Guide*.\n\nVerify that your API key has the required permissions by running the following command:\n\n\t$ curl -H \"Authorization: api_key <vmray_api_key>\" <vmray_platform_url>/rest/email\nThis should return a list of emails that ETD has analyzed."
