# Executive summary

Configure Sentinel and load custom playbooks to have Illusive open Sentinel incidents, populate them with Illusive-based information, and automate incident response.

This solution contains the following components:

- **Incident Enrichment playbook** – leverages Sentinel analytic rules to discover Illusive-based alerts and report the associated data and forensics as Sentinel incident sets.  
  Use this playbook to enrich Sentinel security incidents originating from Illusive with Illusive incident and forensics information. Illusive continues to enrich relevant Sentinel incidents as new events are detected. This is done using the Illusive API resource.
- **Incident Response playbook** – leverages CrowdStrike or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration to automate incident response when specified Illusive incidents are discovered.  
 Use this playbook to quickly stop or slow down ransomware attacks and critical incidents detected by Illusive in your organization. Upon detection, Sentinel is instructed to use the triggering process information reported by Illusive remove or kill the process. If the triggering process cannot be killed, Sentinel is instructed to isolate the host. These capabilities are available for organizations with CrowdStrike Falcon or Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

- **Analytic Rule** - Trigger a Sentinel alert upon detecting an Illusive event and create a Sentinel incident. The Sentinel incident will correspond to the Illusive incident and will include all subsequent associated Illusive events. The Illusive solution playbooks require the analytic rule to operate.

<a name="BasicRequirements">
  
## Basic requirements (set up in advance)

To use the Illusive Active Defense solution, you must have the following:

- An Azure AD subscription with a configured Sentinel workspace
- An Illusive ADS (deceptions) license
- A Linux-based syslog server. To set up the syslog server, [see these instructions from Microsoft](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/sentinel/connect-syslog.md). Then, go to **Data connectors**, find and select the **CEF connector**

# Configure Illusive to send logs to a Linux-based syslog server

Configure Illusive to automatically send Illusive activity logs and event messages to a Linux based Syslog server. Every Syslog message also contains an Illusive incident ID. Sentinel will consume this information and trigger the Illusive solution playbooks.

If you haven't yet configured the syslog server, [see these instructions from Microsoft](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/sentinel/connect-syslog.md). Then, go to **Data connectors** and find and select the **Common event format connector**.

1. In the Illusive Console, navigate to **Settings>Reporting** and scroll down to **Syslog Servers.**
     <p align="center">  
       <img src="./Images/illusive-syslog-server-integration-card.png"> </a>
     </p>
2. In the **Host Name** server field, supply the server IP address or host name.
3. In the **Port** field, supply the Syslog server’s communication port. (Default **514**)
4. From the **Protocol** dropdown menu, select **TCP.**<br>
**Recommendation:** For high reliability, select the TCP protocol.
5. From the **Audit messages** drop-down menu, select one of the following (either option is okay; this integration only requires the event messages):
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>**Option**</th>
              <th>**Description**</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>**Send audit messages to server**</td>
              <td>**Sends Illusive event and audit messages** to your Syslog server</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>**Don’t send audit messages to server**</td>
              <td>**Sends only Illusive event messages and system health data** to your Syslog server</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
6. Click **Add**.
  
<a name="Deploy_Playbooks">
  
# Deploy solution package or deploy playbooks

There are several paths for deploying the Illusive Sentinel solution.

- Deploy the complete solution package. Continue with [Deploy the solution package](#solution-package-deployment) below.
- Deploy just the Incident Enrichment playbook, go to [Incident Enrichment Playbook](./Playbooks/Illusive-SentinelIncident-Enrichment).
- Deploy just the Incident Response playbook, go to [Incident Response Playbook](./Playbooks/Illusive-SentinelIncident-Response).

<a name="solution-package-deployment">

## Deploy the solution package

- Before deploying the Illusive solution package, download the **mainTemplate.json** from the GitHub repository [using this link](https://github.com/IllusiveNetworks-Labs/Azure-Sentinel/blob/bd6e870691fd26ee2998c915d2902a9a36015d7c/Solutions/Illusive%20Active%20Defense/Package/mainTemplate.json).
- The playbook should be deployed under the same resource group, subscription, and workspace as the Azure app.
- The Illusive API key should contain only the API key and no keywords such as “Bearer” or “Basic”.
- You will not be prompted for missing information when saving the custom deployment configuration. If the playbook is incorrect or incomplete, the incident response playbook will not be able to isolate hosts, and you will get a playbook execution level error message.

1. On Azure home page, filter for **Deploy a custom template.**
     <p align="center">  
        <img src="./Images/deploy-custom-template-search.png"> </a>
     </p>
