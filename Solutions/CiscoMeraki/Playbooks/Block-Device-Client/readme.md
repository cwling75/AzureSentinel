![meraki](../../Connector/MerakiConnector/logo.jpg)

## Summary
 When a new Azure Sentinel incident is created, this playbook gets triggered and performs the below actions:
 1. Fetches a list of device clients with suspicious activity.
 2. For each client in the list, checks if the client is blocked by any network of the organization.
  - If client does not exist in network, then incident comment is created saying client not found.
  - If client exists in network, check policy rule associated with client.
     * If client policy does not exist in the network, then incident comment is created saying client policy not found.
     *  If client policy exists in the network as Blocked, then incident comment is created saying client blocked using client policy.
     *  If client policy exists in the network as Whitelisted, then incident comment is created saying client allowed using client policy.
     *  If client policy exists in the network as group polciy, then check the group policy details and  incident comment is created saying client blocked using client policy.
     *  If client policy exists in the network as Normal, then client is blocked by playbook. Incident Comment is created saying Client blocked by playbook.
  - Add incident Comment from all the cases.
3. Update the incident with status 'Closed' and reason as
  - For allowed Client - 'BenignPositive - SuspiciousButExpected'
  - For blocked Client - 'TruePositive - SuspiciousActivity'

# Post-Deployment Instructions 
## a. Authorize API connection
* Once deployment is complete, go under deployment details and authorize Cisco Meraki connection. 
1.  Click the Cisco Meraki connection
2.  Click **Edit API connection**
3.  Enter API Key
4.  Click Save

## b. Configurations in Sentinel
- In Azure sentinel analytical rules should be configured to trigger an incident with hosts. 
- Device Client MAC needs to be mapped with hostname in Host entity.
- Configure the automation rules to trigger the playbook.

# Playbook steps explained
## When Azure Sentinel incident creation rule is triggered
  Captures potentially malicious client incident information.

## Entities - Get Hosts
  Get the list of device clients as entities from the Incident.

## Check if Organization exists
 *  If organization name exists in list of organizations associated with the account, then return organization. 
 *  If organization name does not exist, then terminate with the error that organization not found.

 ## Check if network exists
  *  If network name exists in list of networks associated with the organization, then return network associated with the organization. 
  *  If network name does not exist, then terminate with the error that network not found.

  ## Check if group policy exists
  *  If group policy name exists in list of group policies associated with the network, then return group policy associated with the network. 
  *  If group policy name does not exist, then terminate with the error that group policy not found.

## For each malicious device client received from the incident
- Checks if the client exists in network.
  - If client does not exist in network, then incident comment is created saying client not found.
  - If client exists in network, check policy rule associated with client.
     * If client policy does not exist in the network, then incident comment is created saying client policy not found.
     *  If client policy exists in the network as Blocked, then incident comment is created saying client blocked using client policy.
     *  If client policy exists in the network as Whitelisted, then incident comment is created saying client allowed using client policy.
     *  If client policy exists in the network as group polciy, then check the group policy details and  incident comment is created saying client blocked using client policy.
     *  If client policy exists in the network as Normal, then client is blocked by playbook. Incident Comment is created saying Client blocked by playbook.
  - Add incident Comment from all the cases.
  - Update the incident with status 'Closed' and reason as
    - For allowed Client - 'BenignPositive - SuspiciousButExpected'
    - For blocked Client - 'TruePositive - SuspiciousActivity'
