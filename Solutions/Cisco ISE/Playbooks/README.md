## Custom Connectors + 3 Playbook templates deployment

This package includes:

* [Logic Apps custom connector for Cisco ISE ERS API](./CiscoISEConnector)

* These three playbook templates leverage Cisco ISE custom connector:
  * [Response â€“ release rejected endpoints](./Playbooks/CiscoISE-FalsePositivesClearPolicies) - releases rejected endpoints that are in safe list.
  * [Response - suspend guest user](./Playbooks/CiscoISE-SuspendGuestUser) - suspends guest user.
  * [Response - assign policy to an endpoint](./Playbooks/CiscoISE-TakeEndpointActionFromTeams) - posts adaptive card to Teams channel and assigns policy to an endpoint after approving in Teams.

You can choose to deploy the whole package: connectors + all three playbook templates, or each one seperately from its specific folder.

## Authentication

This connector supports Basic authentication. When creating the connection for the custom connector, you will be asked to provide user and password which you generated in Cisco ISE admin UI.

<a name="prerequisites">

### Prerequisites in Cisco ISE

To get Cisco ISE ERS API credentials [follow the instructions](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/identity-services-engine/#!setting-up).

Cisco ISE connector uses [On-Premises Data Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-onprem). Therefore [installation of the On-Premises Data Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-install) and [creation of the On-Premises Data Gateway resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-connection#create-azure-gateway-resource) are required.
