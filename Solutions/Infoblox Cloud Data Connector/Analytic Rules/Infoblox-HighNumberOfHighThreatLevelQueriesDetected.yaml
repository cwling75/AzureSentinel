name: Infoblox - High Number of High Threat Level Queries Detected
description: |
  'This creates an incident in the event a single host generates at least 200 high threat level RPZ queries (Threat Defense security hits) in 1 hour. Query count threshold and scheduling is customizable. This rule depends on a parser based on a Kusto Function to work as expected called [**InfobloxCDC**](https://aka.ms/sentinel-InfobloxCloudDataConnector-parser).'
