## Summary
 When a new Azure Sentinel incident is created, this playbook gets triggered and performs the below actions:
 1. Fetches a list of potentially malicious URLs.
 2. For each URL in the list, checks if the URL is blocked by any of the networks of the organization.
  - If URL is allowed by the network, then incident comment is created saying URL is allowed.
  - If URL is blocked by the network, then incident comment is created saying URL is blocked.
  - If URL is not blocked by the network and not part of the network, then incident comment is created saying URL not found in network.
