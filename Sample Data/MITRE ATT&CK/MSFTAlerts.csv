The risk detection is triggered when the sign-in occurs from a location that's not already in the list of familiar locations. Newly created users will be in ""learning mode"" for a period of time in which unfamiliar sign-in properties risk detections will be turned off while our algorithms learn the user's behavior. The learning mode duration is dynamic and depends on how much time it takes the algorithm to gather enough information about the user's sign-in patterns. The minimum duration is five days. A user can go back into learning mode after a long period of inactivity. The system also ignores sign-ins from familiar devices, and locations that are geographically close to a familiar location. We also run this detection for basic authentication (or legacy protocols). Because these protocols do not have modern properties such as client ID, there is limited telemetry to reduce false positives. We recommend our customers to move to modern authentication.",N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,Azure Identity Protection Center (IPC)
Admin confirmed user compromised,"This detection indicates an admin has selected 'Confirm user compromised' in the Risky users UI or using riskyUsers API. To see which admin has confirmed this user compromised, check the user's risk history (via UI or API).",N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,Azure Identity Protection Center (IPC)
Malicious IP address,This detection indicates sign-in from a malicious IP address. An IP address is considered malicious based on high failure rates because of invalid credentials received from the IP address or other IP reputation sources.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,Azure Identity Protection Center (IPC)
Suspicious inbox manipulation rules,"This detection is discovered by Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS). This detection profiles your environment and triggers alerts when suspicious rules that delete or move messages or folders are set on a user's inbox. This detection may indicate that the user's account is compromised, that messages are being intentionally hidden, and that the mailbox is being used to distribute spam or malware in your organization.",N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,Azure Identity Protection Center (IPC)
Password spray,A password spray attack is where multiple usernames are attacked using common passwords in a unified brute force manner to gain unauthorized access. This risk detection is triggered when a password spray attack has been performed.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,Azure Identity Protection Center (IPC)
Impossible travel,"This detection is discovered by Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS). This detection identifies two user activities (is a single or multiple sessions) originating from geographically distant locations within a time period shorter than the time it would have taken the user to travel from the first location to the second, indicating that a different user is using the same credentials.",N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,Azure Identity Protection Center (IPC)
New country,This detection is discovered by Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS). This detection considers past activity locations to determine new and infrequent locations. The anomaly detection engine stores information about previous locations used by users in the organization.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,Azure Identity Protection Center (IPC)
Activity from anonymous IP address,This detection is discovered by Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS). This detection identifies that users were active from an IP address that has been identified as an anonymous proxy IP address.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,Azure Identity Protection Center (IPC)
Suspicious inbox forwarding,"This detection is discovered by Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS). This detection looks for suspicious email forwarding rules, for example, if a user created an inbox rule that forwards a copy of all emails to an external address.",N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,Azure Identity Protection Center (IPC)
Azure AD threat intelligence,This risk detection type indicates sign-in activity that is unusual for the given user or is consistent with known attack patterns based on Microsoft's internal and external threat intelligence sources.,N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,Azure Identity Protection Center (IPC)
Additional risk detected,"This detection indicates that one of the above premium detections was detected. Since the premium detections are visible only to Azure AD Premium P2 customers, they are titled ""additional risk detected"" for customers without Azure AD Premium P2 licenses.",N.A.,N.A.,N.A.,Azure Identity Protection Center (IPC)
