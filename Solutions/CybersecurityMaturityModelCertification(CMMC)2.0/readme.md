# Overview
---
The Microsoft Sentinel: Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0 Solution provides a mechanism for viewing log queries aligned to CMMC 2.0 requirements across the Microsoft portfolio. This solution enables governance and compliance teams to design, build, monitor, and respond to CMMC 2.0 requirements across 25+ Microsoft products. The solution includes the new CMMC 2.0 Workbook, (2) Analytics Rules, and (1) Playbook. While only Microsoft Sentinel is required to get started, the solution is enhanced with numerous Microsoft offerings. This Solution enables Security Architects, Engineers, SecOps Analysts, Managers, and IT Pros to gain situational awareness visibility for the security posture of cloud workloads. There are also recommendations for selecting, designing, deploying, and configuring Microsoft offerings for alignment with respective security best practice.

# Getting Started
This Solution is designed to augment staffing through automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, query/alerting generation, and visualizations. This workbook leverages Azure Policy, Azure Resource Graph, and Azure Log Analytics to align with Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification 2.0 control requirements. A filter set is available for custom reporting by guides, subscriptions, workspaces, time-filtering, control family, and level. This offering telemetry from 50+ Microsoft Security products, while only Microsoft Sentinel/Microsoft Defender for Cloud are required to get started, each offering provides additional enrichment for aligning with control requirements. Each CMMC control includes a Control Card detailing an overiew of requirements, primary/secondary controls, deep-links to referenced product pages/portals, recommendations, implementation guides, compliance cross-walks and tooling telemetry for building situational awareness of cloud workloads.

# Workbook
The Microsoft Sentinel CMMC 2.0 Workbook provides a mechanism for viewing log queries, azure resource graph, and policies aligned to CMMC controls across the Microsoft portfolio including Microsoft security offerings, Office 365, Teams, and many more. This workbook enables Security Architects, Engineers, SecOps Analysts, Managers, and IT Pros to gain situational awareness visibility for the security posture of cloud workloads. There are also recommendations for selecting, designing, deploying, and configuring Microsoft offerings for alignment with respective CMMC 2.0 requirements and practices.

# Analytics Rules
The Microsoft Sentinel: CMMC 2.0 Analytics rules leverage Microsoft Defender for Cloud Regulatory Compliance mappings (Derived from NIST SP 800-171) to measure CMMC 2.0 alignment across Level 1 (Foundation) and Level 2 (Advanced) requirements. The default configuration is set for scheduled rules running every 7 days to reduce alert overload. The default configuration is to alert when posture compliance is below 70% and this number is configurable per organizational requirements. 

# Playbooks
## 1) Notify Governance Compliance Team
This Security Orchestration, Automation, & Response (SOAR) capability is designed for configuration with the solution's analytics rules. When analytics rules trigger this automation notifies the governance compliance team of respective details via Teams chat and exchange email. this automation reduces requirements to manually monitor the workbook or analytics rules while increasing response times.<br>
## 2) Open DevOps Task based on Recommendation
This Security Orchestration, Automation, & Response (SOAR) capability is designed to create an Azure DevOps Task when an alert is triggered. This automation enables a consistent response when resources become unhealthy relative to a predefined recommendation, enabling teams to focus on remediation and improving response times.
## 3) Open JIRA Ticket based on Recommendation
This Security Orchestration, Automation, & Response (SOAR) capability is designed to open a Jira issue when a recommendation is unhealthy in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. This automation improves time to response by providing consistant notifications when resources become unhealthy relative to a predefined recommendation.

## Disclaimer
The Microsoft Sentinel CMMC 2.0 Solution demonstrates best practice guidance, but Microsoft does not guarantee nor imply compliance. The workbook outlines controls across Levels 1-2. All accreditation requirements and decisions are governed by the ðŸ’¡[CMMC Accreditation Body](https://www.cmmcab.org/c3pao-lp). This solution provides visibility and situational awareness for control requirements delivered with Microsoft technologies in predominantly cloud-based environments. Customer experience will vary by user and some panels may require additional configurations and query modification for operation. Recommendations should be considered a starting point for planning full or partial coverage of respective control requirements.
