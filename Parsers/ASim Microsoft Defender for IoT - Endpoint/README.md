# ASIM parsers for Microsoft Defender for IoT - Endpoint

This template deploys all [Microsoft Defender for IoT - Endpoint](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-defender-for-iot/) Microsoft Sentinel ASIM parsers. The template is part of the [Advanced SIEM Information Model (ASIM)](https://aka.ms/AzSentinelNormalization).The Advanced SIEM Information Model (ASIM) enables you to use and create source-agnostic content, simplifying your analysis of the data in your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.

When deploying the parsers, you make sure that telemetry from MD4IoT is analyzed using the built-in Microsoft Sentinel Analytics. You also enable analysts easier access to the telemetry using a known, standard, schema.

**Note: to get the best value from ASIM and make sure that Microsoft Defender for IoT - Endpoint telemetry is included in Microsoft Sentinel Analytics, deploy the [full ASIM parser suite](https://aka.ms/AzSentinelASim).**
