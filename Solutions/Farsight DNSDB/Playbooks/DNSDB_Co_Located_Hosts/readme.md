# DNSDB_Co_Located_Hosts
author: Henry Stern, Farsight Security, Inc.

This playbook uses the Farsight DNSDB connector to automatically enrich Domain's found in the Sentinel incidents. This use case describes the desire to easily identify Hosts that are co-located (based on Address) based on the input of a Host and a given point in time. The response would be a set of domains that also shared the same IP address as the originating domain name at the given point in time. 
Learn more about the integration via the https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/farsightdnsdb/ or visit https://www.farsightsecurity.com/about-farsight-security/contacts/ to request a trial key.
