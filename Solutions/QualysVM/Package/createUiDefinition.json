This feature is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/)._\n\n**Note:** _There may be [known issues](https://aka.ms/sentinelsolutionsknownissues) pertaining to this Solution, please refer to them before installing._\n\n[Qualys Vulnerability Management (VM)](https://www.qualys.com/apps/vulnerability-management/) provides global visibility into where your IT assets are vulnerable and how to protect them. As enterprises adopt cloud computing, mobility, and other disruptive technologies for digital transformation, Qualys VM offers next-generation vulnerability management for these hybrid IT environments whose traditional boundaries have been blurred. This is accomplished through agent-based detection from lightweight Qualys Cloud Agents, which extend network coverage to assets that can't be scanned.\n\nAzure Sentinel Solutions provide a consolidated way to acquire Azure Sentinel content like data connectors, workbooks, analytics, and automations in your workspace with a single deployment step.\n\n**Workbooks:** 1, **Analytic Rules:** 2\n\n[Learn more about Azure Sentinel](https://aka.ms/azuresentinel) | [Learn more about Solutions](https://aka.ms/azuresentinelsolutionsdoc)",
