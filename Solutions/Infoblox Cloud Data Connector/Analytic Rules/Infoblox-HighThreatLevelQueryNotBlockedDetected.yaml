name: Infoblox - High Threat Level Query Not Blocked Detected
description: |
  'This creates an incident in the event a single host generates at least 1 high threat level query (Threat Defense security hit) that is not blocked or redirected in 1 hour. Query count threshold and scheduling is customizable. This rule depends on a parser based on a Kusto Function to work as expected called [**InfobloxCDC**](https://aka.ms/sentinel-InfobloxCloudDataConnector-parser).'
