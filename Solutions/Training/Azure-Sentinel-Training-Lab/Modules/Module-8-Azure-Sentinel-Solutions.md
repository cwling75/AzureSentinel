3. Notice that these rules are created in **Disabled** state. In a real-world environment, you would need to enable them.

4. Navigate to **Workbooks** under Threat Management. Switch to **My Workbooks** tab and search for Dynamics. You can see the newly deployed workbook. This should be empty unless you have enabled the Dynamics 365 connector.
