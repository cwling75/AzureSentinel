  "Description": "There has been a long-standing split between ICS/SCADA (OT) and Corporate (IT) cybersecurity. This split was often driven by significant differences in technology/tooling. Microsoft Defender for IoT's integration with Azure Sentinel drives convergency by providing a single pane for coverage of both D4IOT (OT) and Azure Sentinel (IT) alerting. This solution includes Workbooks, Analytics rules, and Playbooks providing a guide OT detection, Analysis, and Response.",
