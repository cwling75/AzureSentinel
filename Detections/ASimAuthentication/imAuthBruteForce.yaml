name: Brute force attack against user credentials (Uses Authentication Normalization)
description: |
  'Identifies evidence of brute force activity against a user highlighting multiple authentication failures 
  and by a successful authentication within a given time window. 
  (The query does not enforce any sequence - eg requiring the successful authentication to occur last.)
  Default Failure count is 10, Default Success count is 1 and default Time Window is 20 minutes.
  To use this analytics rule, make sure you have deployed the [ASIM normalization parsers](https://aka.ms/AzSentinelAuthentication)'
